# RSG Django Template

This project is a Django-based website created by the Research Software Group. This is our template for all new Django projects.
When you make a project please mention (in a git commit?) which version of the template project you used - E.g. "Based on django-template commit 8asde872"

## Using this as a template to start up a new project

* Fork this template project (just click "fork" in GitLab)
* Change the places it talks about being a template project into your own project (e.g. name) and send a merge request to get the changes merged *in your new repository*.
* We would not normally expect you to pull any new changes from the template into your fork, or push any changes back. There may be exceptions to this though.
